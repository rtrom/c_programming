# C Programming: A Modern Approach Examples and Exercises

Welcome to the **C Programming: A Modern Approach** Examples and Exercises repository!

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of examples and exercises from the book "C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K.N. King. It serves as a practical guide to learn and practice C programming concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples and exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rtrom/c_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd c_programming
   ```

3. Each chapter's examples and exercises are organized in separate directories. Browse through the directories and locate the code or exercise you wish to explore.

4. Open the desired example or exercise file using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

5. Study the code and comments to understand the concepts being demonstrated. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.

6. If you encounter any issues or have questions, you can refer to the book or seek help from the C programming community.

## Contents

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a chapter from the book "C Programming: A Modern Approach." Here's an overview of the contents:

```
├── ch1
│   ├── examples
│   │   ├── hello_world.c
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   └── ...
│   └── exercises
│       ├── exercise1.c
│       ├── ...
│       └── ...
├── ch2

    │   └── ...
    └── exercises
        ├── exerciseN.c
        ├── ...
        └── ...
```

Each chapter directory contains two subdirectories: `examples` and `exercises`. The `examples` directory includes example files demonstrating the concepts discussed in that particular chapter, while the `exercises` directory contains exercise files for practicing and reinforcing the learned material.

Feel free to explore the directories, examine the code, and work on the exercises to enhance your understanding of C programming.
